### About

Web application which graphically displays stellar systems and wormholes between them in the MMORPG (game) Eve Online ([http:/www.eveonline.com](http:/www.eveonline.com)). The map is based on information uploaded by the players. It also helps managing the income from operations in wormhole space.

The project was initially made to support the operations of one corporation, but after receiving positive feedback it was upgraded to support multiple corporations and languages.

It was open sourced after multiple players expressed thoughts that the information in the tool (uploaded by them) can be used against them (in the game).

At the time the project was the first public mapping tool for wormhole space in Eve Online. The application was supported for couple of months until I stopped playing the game, soon after that is became old dated. However it was used as starting point for similar projects. It was also copied and uploaded for private use by corporations.
